    <div class="jaddu1">
       <p>Chamari Athapaththu's career-best 119* helped Sri Lanka thump Malaysia <br>
         by a whopping 144 runs in their Women's Asia Cup encounter at Dambulla on <br>
          Monday. The captain carried her bat through the innings, slamming 7 sixes <br>
           and 14 boundaries en route to her third T20I ton, and first at home, to <br>
            power Sri Lanka's highest total in the format - 184/4. Malaysia stuttered <br>
             right from the start, and could muster only 40 in the reply.</p>    
             <p>Malaysia's left-arm pacer Suabika Manivannan struck with her first ball to <br>
                 remove Sri Lanka's half-centurion from the previous game, but there was no <br>
                  stopping Athapaththu. The captain took charge and combined with Harshitha <br>
                   Samarawickrama to forge a 64-run partnership. The pair ensured they had <br>
                    a boundary coming every over before the skipper went on the offensive <br>
                     against Aisya Eleesa, hitting three boundaries to make a very productive <br>
                      14-run final PP over before the fielding restrictions were lifted.</p>
                      <p>Their inexperience showed as there were plenty of errors in Malaysia's lines <br>
                         and lengths and Athapaththu did not spare any single loose delivery. Anything <br>
                          short, wide or overpitched was duly dispatched. Athapaththu truly only flicked <br>
                           the switch after the half-way mark, and clobbered back-to-back sixes off her <br>
                            counterpart to raise a 35-ball half-century. From a team fifty in the seventh <br>
                             over, the home team's hundred was up in the 12th and Malaysia had no answers. <br>
                              But this was only the beginning of the assault. The momentary relief in this <br>
                               phase was when Mahirah Izzati Ismail yorked Samarawickrama for her 50th T0I <br>
                                wicket in her 50th match.</p>
                                <p>In the slog overs, Athapaththu was just toying with the attack and fetched sixes <br>
                                     for fun. It didn't help Malaysia's cause either that they were shoddy in the <br>
                                      field. After a lucky boundary off Ainna Hamizah Hashim, the Sri Lankan skipper <br>
                                       hacked two sixes - one onto the sightscreen and next pulled midwicket - to <br>
                                        march into 90s. Eleesa was at the receiving end of two straight sixes to long-on <br>
                                         in the next over as Athapaththu reached her hundred in style, off just 63 balls. <br>
                                          Duraisingam too leaked one in the final over as the Sri Lanka skipper took her <br>
                                           team past their previous best T20I total of 182. However, wickets off final-two <br>
                                            balls prevented further damage for Malaysia.</p>
