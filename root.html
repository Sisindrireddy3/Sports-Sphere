       <p>England set West Indies 385 runs to win the Trent Bridge Test with four full <br>
         sessions left after Joe Root completed a century in the post-lunch session. <br>
          Root, who was batting on 81 when the session began, brought up a wonderful <br>
           century to score 122 as England got bowled out for 425, extending their lead <br>
            to 384 in the process.</p>
            <p>Root took little time to move into the nineties once the session commenced <br>
                 as he cut Kevin Sinclair for a boundary through the covers. The onus was <br>
                  on the former England skipper to guide England to substantial score after <br>
                   West Indies fought back hard by the end of the morning session with three <br> strikes.</p>
                   <p>In their attempt to polish off the lower order, West Indies did take the second <br>
                     new ball straightaway and plan worked with Chris Woakes edging Shamar <br> Joseph behind 
                      to the slip cordon. Root, who completed his ton in the following <br> over, then opened 
                       up against Joseph with two boundaries. With Gus Atkinson <br> moving to 16 in quick
                        time, there was a real possibility of England easily <br> extending  their lead  past 400.</p>
                        <p>However, the visitors struck in quick succession once again, just like they <br>
                             did in the first session. As a result, in no time, 419/7 became 425 all out. <br>
                              Root hit one straight to covers before Jayden Seales sent Mark Wood and Shoaib <br>
                               Bashir packing. With no team ever chasing over 300 in the fourth innings of a <br>
                                Test match at this venue, the home side would still feel confident of having <br>
                                 enough on the board.</p>
                                 <p>Brief scores: England 416 & 425 (Joe Root 122, Harry Brook 109; Jayden Seales <br>
                                     4/97) lead West Indies 457 by 384 runs</p>
