      <p>West Indies managed to pick three wickets in the morning session at Trent <br>
         Bridge on the fourth day but England stretched their lead beyond 300 after <br>
          Harry Brook's century and Joe Root's unbeaten 81.</p>
          <p>Root and Brook continued from where they left by stumps on the third day <br>
             with the latter finding the boundary in the very first over of the day. <br>
              Brook found the boundary on two more occasions straight down the ground <br>
               to move into the 90s before eventually bringing up his first Test century <br>
                 at home.</p>
                 <p>In the same over, Root went past fifty for the 63rd time in Test cricket, with <br>
                     only Sachin Tendulkar and Shivnarine Chanderpaul ahead of him. West Indies <br>
                      endured a very frustrating spell with these two batters looking very comfortable <br>
                       in the middle. However, just a few overs before the break, West Indies looked to <br>
                        pull things back with quick wickets.</p>
                        <p>The 189-run partnership came to an end when Brook edged one behind to <br>
                             the keeper and then a few overs later, it was the turn of Ben Stokes <br>
                              to return to the pavilion as soon as he found the fielder stationed <br>
                               at deep square leg. The mini comeback was complete when Kevin Sinclair <br>
                                managed to pick up a wicket off the final ball of the session, leaving <br>
                                 Root stranded on 81 at the other end.</p>
                                 <p>Brief scores: England 416 & 348/6 (Harry Brook 109, Joe Root 81*) <br>
                                     lead West Indies 457 by 307 runs</p>
