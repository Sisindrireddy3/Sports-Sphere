       <p style="color: grey; margin-left: 10px; font-size: 1.2rem;">Hardik Pandya was not considered for captaincy because of his fitness concerns.</p>

    <div class="jaddu1">
        <p>Selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar has clarified the reasoning behind <br>
             certain  key decisions  taken ahead of India's upcoming white-ball tour of Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>Hardik Pandya, who had served as the vice-captain during India's victorious <br> T20 World 
             Cup campaign recently, had been overlooked for the top job with <br> Suryakumar Yadav taking 
              over captaincy instead following the retirement of <br> Rohit Sharma. As previously reported
               by Cricbuzz, Agarkar cited Pandya's  <br> fitness as the prime reason behind the decision.</p>
               <p>"Obviously, you want a captain that is likely to play all the games. We think he's <br> [Suryakumar 
                 Yadav] a deserving candidate, over time we'll see how he develops <br> into the role," Agarkar said 
                  in a press conference on Monday (July 22).</p>
                  <p>"As regards to Hardik, he's still a very important player for us. That's what we <br> want, him to be 
                     the player that can be. Those sorts of skillsets are very difficult <br> to find, what he has. Fitness 
                      obviously has been a challenge for him over the last <br> few years and that then becomes a little bit 
                       more difficult for a coach or even us <br> selectors...</p>
                       <p>"We've got a bit more time till the next T20 World Cup where we can look at a <br> few things and it's 
                         not rushed at the moment. We want him... like I said, he's <br> an important player for us and hopefully
                          his performances are more important. <br> I mean the fitness is a clear challenge and we want someone who
                           is likely <br> to be available more often than not. Again, after saying all that, I think Surya <br> has got 
                            the necessary qualities you need to succeed as a captain," explained <br> Agarkar.</p>
                            <p>"We've got a little bit more time. Since I've come, there's been a 50-over World Cup <br>
                                 almost followed by the 20-over World Cup. Like I said, fitness is a concern. Not <br>
                                  just that, we also feel that Surya has the necessary qualities to be a good <br>
                                   captain. Hopefully, we see that over time. Two years is a long time. So at least, <br>
                                    it gives us a bit more of a chance, to try and look at some things differently. <br>
                                     And the main thing is we want the guys who are available all the time. In this way, <br>
                                      we also feel we can manage Hardik a little bit better. Because like I said, he's <br>
                                       an important player for us. We've seen even in this World Cup, his performances <br>
                                        both with the bat and ball are important. And that is more important to the team <br>
                                         than anything else," he said.</p>
