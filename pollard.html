       <h1> Rashid, Pooran and Pollard <br> step up to fire MINY to the <br> playoffs</h1>

    <div class="jaddu1">
        <p>MI New York's big players stepped up in a must-win clash to fire the defending <br>
             champions to the MLC 2024 playoffs. Rashid Khan claimed 3 for 22 as LAKR were <br>
              restricted to just 130. MINY then needed to chase that score down in 18.2 overs <br>
               to surpass their opposition on Net Run Rate and Nicholas Pooran (35 off 28) and <br>
                Kieron Pollard (33* off 12) played key knocks to ensure the target was hauled <br>
                 down with 18 balls to spare.</p>
                 <p>MINY seemed up for it from the get go once they elected to bowl on a sluggish <br>
                     wicket. Trent Boult dismissed Sunil Narine in his first over and although <br>
                      Jason Roy got off to a brisk start with a six off Boult and a pair of boundaries <br>
                       off Nosthush Kenjige, MINY also bagged the wicket of Unmukt Chand in a 45-run <br>
                        PowerPlay. The dismissal of the former India U-19 captain going into the <br>
                         middle-overs phase was particularly critical given how spin was expected to <br>
                          play a big part.</p>
                          <p>Rashid struck with just his fourth delivery as a googly snuck under Roy's attempted <br>
                             slog and knocked back the offstump. At the other end, Kenjige had David Miller <br>
                              holing out to long on to an attempted heave, leaving the Knight Riders struggling <br>
                               at 62 for 4 at the half-way point of their innings. Between them, the two MINY <br>
                                spinners took 5 for 44 in eight overs to send the LAKR innings into a tailspin. <br>
                                 Kenjige then dismissed Saif Badar while Rashid castled a rusty Nitish Kumar and <br>
                                  then trapped Spencer Johnson LBW after a missed sweep.</p>
                         <p>At 101 for 9, LAKR were headed to a grossly sub-par score but they were propped <br>
                             up to something of a fighting total by an Andre Russell (35 off 21) cameo. The <br>
                              West Indian struck two back-to-back boundaries off Rashid and then repeated that <br>
                               feat in the following over bowled by Romario Shepherd. Farming the strike with <br>
                                only No.11 Joshua Little for company, Russell took down Boult for two fours and <br>
                                 a six. By the 19th over, Russell had powered LAKR to 130 but his attempts to add <br>
                                  further to the toal in the final over was put paid by a clever short ball from <br>
                                   Kieron Pollard that rushed Russell on the pull and ballooned up off the spice.</p>    
                                   <p>Brief scores: LA Knight Riders 130 in 19.1 overs (Andre Russell 35; Rashid Khan <br>
                                     3-22, Nosthush Kenjige 2-22) lost to MI New York 134/6 in 17 overs (Nicholas Pooran <br>
                                      35, Kieron Pollard 33*; Sunil Narine 2-24) by four wickets</p>
